# CS-435: Computational Photography Winter Quarter
This repo contains implementations of computational photography projects for course work and fun!

## Descriptions
### Pixel Operations
This project computes various point based pixel operations, such as manually converting an RGB image to binary and grayscale.
It also generates a histogram of the pixel intensities and performs contrast stretching on the grayscale image.

### High Dynamic Range (HDR)
This project creates an HDR image from a data set of images taken at different exposures. It also tonemaps the HDR image for viewing
on SDR displays.

### Retargeting (Seam Carving)
This project performs content aware resizing by implementing a dynamic programming algorithm to remove the least significant
seams in an image

### Classification (K-NN)
This project implements a K-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithm for classifiying images as cars or not cars.

### Morphing
This project performs morphing on two images based on a list of corresponding points.
